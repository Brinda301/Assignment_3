This file contains starter code for the three different autocomplete engines
you are writing for this assignment.

As usual, be sure not to change any parts of the given *public interface* in the
starter code---and this includes the instance attributes, which we will be
testing directly! You may, however, add new private attributes, methods, and
top-level functions to this file.
